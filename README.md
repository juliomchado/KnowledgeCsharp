# KnowledgeCsharp

This repository is a personal collection of everything I learned about **C#**, mostly from around 2018 to 2020—covering studies from my Computer Science degree, online courses, and a lot of self-driven practice. All code here was written before I started working as a software developer.

> **Note:**  
> Many files, comments, and exercises are in Portuguese, especially in my earliest codes and projects.

## What does this repository include?

- **Academic, Course, and Self-Taught Content:**  
  This archive brings together university assignments, exercises from various online courses, and lots of independent projects.  
  > **It documents a significant part of my C# learning journey prior to entering the professional job market as a developer.**  
  > It is *not* a complete record of all my studies or developments during this period, but rather an important set of academic, course, and self-study work mainly from around 2018 to 2020.

- **Sorting Algorithms:**  
  Includes classic and LeetCode-style problems (see [`ExercicioDia2309`](https://github.com/juliomchado/KnowledgeCsharp/tree/master/ExercicioDia2309/ExercicioDia2309/Program.cs) and the `MetodosDeOrdenacao` directory).

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
  Encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, constructors, and core OOP fundamentals throughout various folders.

- **LINQ & Lambda:**  
  Practice and experiments, e.g., `DemoLINQcmLambda`, `DemoLINQcmLambdaPT2`.

- **Web and Backend:**  
  My first web/backend experiments (`SalesWebMvc`)—exploring beyond console and desktop.

- **File & Data Handling, Exceptions, and More:**  
  File I/O (`FileStream_StreamReader`), exception handling, enums, dates/times, delegates, extension methods, arrays, lists, and more.

- **Banking Simulations and Practical Projects:**  
  Small banking system projects for practicing object-oriented modeling (`Bank_V2.0`, `Banco2.1V`, `SistemaBancoConsole`).

- **Problem Solving:**  
  Folders filled with formal and informal exercises, challenge sets, and projects from both academic assignments and independent coding practice.

This repository is a snapshot of my C# learning mainly between 2018 and 2020, entirely before my first job as a developer. It serves as a reference, code archive, and learning resource for anyone interested in C#—from fundamentals to some advanced concepts.
