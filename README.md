# KnowledgeCsharp

This repository is a personal collection gathering **C#** code written mostly between 2018 and 2020. It includes projects done during my Computer Science degree, online courses, and self-study — all prior to my professional experience as a developer and, above all, **represents what I managed to save from that period**.

> **Note:**  
> Many files, comments, and exercises are in Portuguese, especially in the older projects.

## What does this repository include?

- **Academic, Course, and Self-Taught Content:**  
  University assignments, exercises from online courses, and independent projects — a part of what I studied and saved from that time.

- **Sorting Algorithms:**  
  Classic and LeetCode-style problems (see [`ExercicioDia2309`](https://github.com/juliomchado/KnowledgeCsharp/tree/master/ExercicioDia2309/ExercicioDia2309/Program.cs) and the `MetodosDeOrdenacao` directory).

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
  Encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, constructors, and OOP fundamentals across various folders.

- **LINQ & Lambda:**  
  Practice and experimentation in `DemoLINQcmLambda` and `DemoLINQcmLambdaPT2`.

- **Web and Backend:**  
  Early backend/web code (`SalesWebMvc`) and some initial front-end experiments for desktop applications.

- **File Handling, Exceptions, and More:**  
  Examples with file I/O (`FileStream_StreamReader`), exception handling, enums, dates, delegates, extension methods, arrays, lists, and more.

- **Banking Simulations, Console Chess, and Practical Projects:**  
  Projects like `Bank_V2.0`, `Banco2.1V`, `SistemaBancoConsole` for object-oriented modeling, plus a playable **chess game in the console with an interactive text interface**.

- **Problem Solving:**  
  Folders containing exercises, challenges, and projects from university, online courses, and personal study.
